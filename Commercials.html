    <!-- Oh I *love* crit cola, but I only drink diet crit cola. Troll juice... is well I'm going to be honest I can't say I love it because I don't I'm just so addicted, I cannot start my day without one. The first thing I do in the morning is grab one. Waukeen knows I've probably spent more gold and blade coin on Troll Juice than anything else in my entire life... its bad...-->
