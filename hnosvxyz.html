    <h4>It's dark, so very dark. At all times I hear the sound of something grinding and breaking. Like teeth gnashing through metal and glass. With each snap or crash I feel like I'm dying. Someone help me. Whatever treasures are left in these god forsaken ruins
        cannot be worth this. But I can't find the way out, and my soul is getting weaker. Perhaps the answer lies somewhere here, in the dark, but I cannot find it. </h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h4 style="color: black;">Wck</h4>
