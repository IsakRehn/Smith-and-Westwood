    <h4> I used to be a general you know, threw it all away over pride and ego. Honestly though, it kinda worked out. I much prefer being ungodly rich maybe a young me wouldn't have agreed but what's it been now? like thousands of years? Immortality offers a certain
        perspective after all. It's also really nice being free of that sword, or I guess I'm not exactly free but I have a lot more freedom thats a better way to put it. Besides I still get to do my favorite thing, bringing order to savages, wether they want it
        or not.<br><br>Signed<br>
