    <h4>Naouh Naouh dear congregation, DEAR CONGREGATION, calm yourselves, calm yourselves. All shall be explained of course. You see I did it in the name of our God above in heaven, bound in red string, granted me this currency. Perhaps in a round about way but 
        isn't that how the lord works?! In mysterious ways? I do declare this was his way of absolving the mayor of his crimes, by having him pay me... I mean the church, this coin, he repented for his sins. Besides, you should all be happy I spent it on myself.
        I was just teaching you all a lesson! A lesson that's right! Illmater teaches us that through suffering we are saved, and seeing this crowd gathered with torches and pitchforks, have I not granted you audience with God through your pain?! No, NO STOP. NO!.
        this is Real Craven Off you all! Stop! I say BACK! HELP!
    </h4>
