    <h4>There was this old, self-rightous, bag of bones once. He asked me a <span style="color: black;">q</span>uestion ¨What is the worth of a single mortal's life?¨ He thou<span style="color: black;">g</span>ht he was so profound, I bet. Probably wanted me to answer something like ¨all life is sacred, and of infinite value¨<br>
        but I kn<span style="color: black;">o</span>w better than that, everything has a price, and most souls aren't worth more than a single coin. At least not to the ones <span style="color: black;">w</span>ho hold the power to bargain for them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Or maybe they do hold infinite value who knows? But that's really hard to sell so eh, I'm good with the coin.</h4>
