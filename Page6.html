   <!-- Alright before you get the secret I just want to say one last thing. This weapon is theoretically absurd right? Why would the put this on the public market? Whatever though, James does what James does, that dude is wack. Alright here's the secret ''gdtogoqq'' 7/8 well done! oh and the last letter is N its not P, if you don't know what I mean by that you'll figure it out pretty soon I think. Or maybe not maybe this was nr 1 for you! Well I'll see you at the end.-->

            <h4 style="font-size: larger;">For the final piece of this <span style="font-style: italic;">magazine</span> we thought we'd throw the wizards and warlocks a bone, for their necromancy rituals. Well perhaps this isn't really as much of a bone as its 
            something that creates them but even so this is one deadly tool. Now we'll start with the absolutely amazing part, the thing you won't believe is real. These guns are made in a rune factory and carved with pact-forged magic, that means that each
            kill made with one is technically a sacrifice using the proper ritual rites to the keeper of drowned souls, the one who carries the NAME Blibdoolpoolp (yes, you read that right). <br><br>Now I know the more scholarly of you, and thats probably most of you interested in this gun, will
            say ''Handsome author of this fine and reputable magazine, isn't Blibdoolpoolp and evil deity spawned from the madness of the Kuo-toans'' and yes you'd be right. But don't worry, our rune factories are time tested experts, we wouldn't put this 
            on the market if it wasn't 100% safe. <br><br>So the second question you have might then is, why though? and that's a decent question astute reader. Well you see with these proper rights and the madness inherent to the deity she doesn't really care 
            or think about who's giving her what she only responds in kind. So for every tenth creature you kill with this weapon your spells become stronger, she'll grant you either +1 to spell save or +1 to spell attack. On top of that this weapon functions
            perfectly as a spell casting focus for anything from wizards to clerics. That means that you can become an unstoppable force of weave-based destruction by just blasting away with this thing! That is incredible!</h4>

            <h4 style="font-size: larger;">Alright... So whats the bad part? Well you see the arcane forging of this weapon renders it a bit less effective than its standard revolver counter parts, it only deals a d6 of damage. Sure that damage matches whatever
            damage type your most recent spell delt but its still a single d6. It's runework is also delicate enough that magic that affects the gun itself rather than being fired from the gun as focus doesn't work. That means you hexblades can't pact it,
            eldritch knights can't bind it and so on. This weapon will only ever be reliant on your physical skill (your procicency + dexterity, for those of you that like our state based descriptions). <br><br>Spells fired from this thing also don't contribute to the 
            sacrifice count. This all means that it's actually pretty hard to rack up those kills. <br><br>Blibdoolpoolp also wont accept just anything as a sacrifice, you can't go around shooting squirells with this thing. Any large animal such as a boar or a Goblin
            would count but insects of the standard size variety, is a no go. Theoretically there is probably also a limit to Blibdoolpoolps generosity but none that our customers have reported yet. Ol' Charles McDougan is up to +5 on his spell save and +3 to
            his spell attack, that's the highest on record and he's not been cut off yet. Just, be aware Smith & Westwood isn't responsible if the well dries out after +5/+5 or something. But all in all a weapon with this kind of potential for o<span style="color: crimson;">n</span>ly 200g or BC
            equivalent is downright insanity! But that's what you get when you deal with the Drowning godess after all! Illmater preserve your enemies once the ball starts rolling.
