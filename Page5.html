    <!-- Technology is moving so fast. But if this is a semi-automatic whats a fully automatic then? Like would that reload itself or just never run out of bullets or something? Alright alright page 6 is where the secret is, thanks for hanging out with me though, its been fun.-->

            <h4 style="font-size: larger;"> As we are moving towards t<span style="color: crimson;">h</span>e end of the of this issue as always we like to highlight some more standard weaponry. This month we are looking at a rather interesting weapon from The Ratling Gunner & Co.
                These sexy Kobolds have out done themselves again. This piece is quite something you see its what's called semi-automatic. Unlike the revolver where you chamber each round separately, or the manual chambering clips of bolt-action 
                or lever-action rifles. This thing comes with something called a ''Magazine'' that contains all the bullets you'll need and with each pull of the trigger the next one is chambered automatically meaning you'll be able to fire as fast
                as you can pull that trigger.<br><br> This magazine can hold an amazing 15 bullets in such a small handheld weapon. Quite the feat of engineering us here at Smith & Westwood think. Now sadly the weapon isn't quite as attractive as its Kobold
                creators, so if its style you're looking for this isn't for you, but it's undeniably effective.<br><br> It's small size and incredible fire rate also makes it a great weapon for the average farmhand or miner who isn't out slinging spells and guns
                regularly. It does eat through ammunition and each bullet doesn't punch quite as hard as the larger revolver or rifle variants. You'll need to fire about 3 bullets to reach 2d6 of damage, which means you'll be paying for 3 times the ammo
                even if the 9mm is cheap comparatively per bullet the cost is still fairly high if you're the combative sort. The neat part is that since you can just keep pulling that trigger, even the untrained can shoot multiple times per turn! Which is
                wholly unique to these Semi-automatics. Granted each extra attack comes with a -1 to hit so if you unload the whole magazine you'll mostly be wasting it but sometimes that's just what you need.<br><br> Now since these only hit the market earlier
                this year, there's no garantee you'll find them in the more untamed parts of the west but if you can snag one it shouldn't run you more than 25 GOLDEN coins or equivalent blade coins.
