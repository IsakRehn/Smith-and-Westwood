    <!-- 8/8 Told you I'd meet you here. Anyways, if you really need it I'm told someone has a hint, I don't know who that someone is just that you'd be able to contact them? Final challenge oooh exciting!-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"></link>
    <title>Hello</title>

    <h4>Wow, you made it all the way here. I didn't think anyone would. It's pretty obscure and all. But a reward is waiting for you, don't you worry about that. Nurturing talent is good for buisness. Now to solve this final part you'll need these two answers<br>
        1: An organism living in symbiosis with another is called?<br>
        2: What is the current year?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Find the 7 words. Answer the final question. Provide me with the answer and you'll have your reward. Oh and I'd be remiss not to mention, the more of you that complete this, the greater the reward. But if I suspect foul play even just a hint, you get nothing. You'll all have to this on your own. Good luck.
